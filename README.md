Vimo is a passion project by <a href="https://twitter.com/charleshkang1"</a> Charles Kang</a>. I really love music and discovering new music has become somewhat of a hobby of mine over the years. I also really love great UI and UX, so I wanted to make something that really expresses those passions in an app.

Until recently, I was working on an app called Alarmify, but creating alarms just didn't excite me. I want to create something exciting! Something that gets the people going.

I'm going to be working on this as much as I can, but if you happen to find this repo and want to contribute, please feel free!

<strong>Technical Stuff & ETC</strong>
<ul>
  <li> Vimo is written in Objective-C</li>
